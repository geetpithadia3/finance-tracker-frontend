# **Requirements Document: Per-User Application-Level Encryption for Transactions**

## **Objective**
Enhance data security by ensuring that each user’s transaction data (`description` and `amount`) is encrypted at rest using a unique encryption key per user. Only the authenticated user (and the backend, with proper authorization) can encrypt and decrypt their own transaction data.

---

## **Functional Requirements**

### 1. **Per-User Encryption Key**
- Each user must have a unique encryption key generated at the time of registration.
- The encryption key must be securely stored, encrypted with a server-side master key.
- The master key must be stored securely (e.g., environment variable, KMS, or secrets manager).

### 2. **Transaction Data Encryption**
- The `description` and `amount` fields of each transaction must be encrypted using the user’s encryption key before being stored in the database.
- When retrieving transactions, the backend must decrypt these fields using the authenticated user’s key.

### 3. **Key Management**
- The system must support secure generation, storage, and retrieval of user encryption keys.
- The system must support key rotation for both the master key and user keys.
- The system must never expose encryption keys to the frontend or unauthorized users.

### 4. **Access Control**
- Only the authenticated user can access and decrypt their own transaction data.
- The backend must enforce strict access control to prevent users from accessing or decrypting other users’ data.

### 5. **Migration**
- Existing transaction data must be migrated to the new encrypted format.
- A migration script must be provided to encrypt all existing `description` and `amount` fields using the appropriate user key.

### 6. **Audit and Logging**
- All access to encryption keys and decrypted data must be logged for audit purposes.
- Failed decryption or unauthorized access attempts must be logged and alerted.

## **Non-Functional Requirements**

### 1. **Performance**
- Encryption and decryption operations must not introduce significant latency to transaction creation or retrieval.

### 2. **Security**
- Encryption must use a strong, industry-standard algorithm (e.g., Fernet/AES).
- The master key must be rotated periodically and stored securely.
- User keys must be rotated as needed, with a process for re-encrypting existing data.

### 3. **Reliability**
- The system must handle key loss or corruption gracefully, with clear error messages and recovery procedures.

## **Implementation Steps**

1. **Key Generation**
   - Generate a unique encryption key for each user at registration.
   - Encrypt the user key with the master key and store it in the user’s record.

2. **Key Retrieval**
   - On user authentication, retrieve and decrypt the user’s encryption key using the master key.

3. **Encrypt/Decrypt Transaction Data**
   - Encrypt `description` and `amount` with the user’s key before saving.
   - Decrypt these fields with the user’s key when retrieving.

4. **Migration**
   - Write and run a script to encrypt all existing transaction data.

5. **Access Control**
   - Ensure all transaction access is scoped to the authenticated user.

6. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all key access and decryption operations.

---

## **Out of Scope**
- Client-side encryption.
- Sharing of encrypted data between users.
- Encryption of other fields or tables not specified.

---

## **Risks and Mitigations**
- **Key Loss:** If the master key is lost, all user keys (and thus data) are unrecoverable. Mitigate by securely backing up the master key.
- **Performance Impact:** Encryption may add latency. Mitigate by benchmarking and optimizing code.
- **Migration Errors:** Data migration may fail. Mitigate by testing migration scripts on staging data.

---

## **Success Criteria**
- All new and existing transaction data is encrypted at rest per user.
- Only authenticated users can access and decrypt their own transaction data.
- No unauthorized access to encryption keys or decrypted data is possible.
